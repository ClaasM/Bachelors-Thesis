Nowadays, more and more large corporations maintain an active social media presence.
This results in large amounts of interactions with customers, that are impossible to monitor manually.
In this thesis, sentiment analysis and topic modeling are combined and applied to streamed social network data to address this problem.
\\
Several technologies, along with Twitter, from which the data will be streamed, are introduced and explained.
After a comprehensive comparison of methods and algorithms used for sentiment analysis and topic modeling,
the best ones are applied to a sample dataset collected from Twitter,
and the results are combined and visualized.
\\
Lastly, a web-dashboard is developed to apply these analyses on real-time streams
and make them available to a broader, non-technical audience.

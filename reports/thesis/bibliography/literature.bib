abstract="Cloud computing is an emerging technology with a high impact on the operation and development of applications. Scalable web applications in particular can benefit from the advantages of Platform-as-a-Service solutions as they simplify development and maintenance. Unfortunately most of these offerings are a kind of one-way road as they lock the applications in the platform and vendor. This paper describes the TwoSpot platform we have developed to provide broader access to the advantages of Platform-as-a-Service and Infrastructure-as-a-Service functionalities by applying open and standards-based technologies.",

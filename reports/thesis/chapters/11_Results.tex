When streaming from the sample stream, from which the sample dataset was collected,
the topic distribution does not approach that of the sample dataset.
This can be expected, since the topics written about on Twitter change over time.

Showing how the distribution of topics approaches that of the sample dataset when streaming from the sample stream with the same (default) settings.
Showing different dsitributions with different settings.
Showing how the distribution changes during events that influence the twitter sphere.

Spark does not yet offer sufficient funcationality,
and even though it enables using libraries,
it didn't really make sense here.

\chapter{Open Source Contributions}
\label{ch:openSourceContributions}

Some open source contributions were made in the process implementing this thesis, they are listed here.
Where it made sense (low cohesion), parts of the projects were outsourced into packages etc. to be more manageable.

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Pyspark lda streaming
    \item
    Quantitative comparison of Sentiment Analysis algorithms for twitter data
    \item
    Sanders dataset hydration script (sanders-fast-download), because the dataset is good but hard to come by
\end{itemize}

This should also be around 1 page long.

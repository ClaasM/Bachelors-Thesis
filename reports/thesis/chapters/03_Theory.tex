\chapter{Background Theory}

\label{ch:backgroundTheory}

There is reason to believe companies would benefit from being able to analyze what their customers talk about (topics) and how they feel about these topics (sentiment by topic)

It could be used...
\begin{itemize}
    \item
    to monitor consumer sentiment
    \item
    to react to changes in sentiment in real-time (prevent and counteract "shitstorms")
    \item
    to use it as a feedback cycle for product development
\end{itemize}

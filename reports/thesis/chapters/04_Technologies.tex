\chapter{Technologies used}

\label{ch:technologiesUsed}

I explain all the technologies used (excluding the dashboard) here, so that I can give code examples and talk about implementation
while introducing the theory for sentiment analysis and topic modeling, for the reader to be able to make the connection easier.

\textbf{Since it has great influence in the general structur: Do you think this is a good idea?}

The Libraries used for each of the algorithms will be explained in their respective chapters;
I only talk about technologes/design patterns etc that are used across all of them

\begin{itemize}
    \item
    Spark offers some good data analysis functions (maybe show wordcount code here), but its real strength lies in the fact any library can be used on the execution node, which is why I use other libraries quite liberally
    \item
    The Factory pattern was used often because of how python handles scopes
    \item

\end{itemize}

About 2 pages introducing the technologies.

A set of technologies appropriate for this application will be determined.
A quantitative comparison of methods used for sentiment analysis and topic modeling will be made,
and the best method for this use case determined.
\\
That way, this thesis will provide a way to analyze sentiment of tweets and model their topics,
as well as the combination of those.
\\
The final solution will provide a way to create a stream of real-time tweets and the associated analysis,
which can be filtered according to the users preferences to analyze only the activity most relevant to them.

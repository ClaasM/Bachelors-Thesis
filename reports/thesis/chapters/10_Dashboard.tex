\chapter{Dashboard}

\label{ch:dashboard}

A user-friendly streaming dashboard was created to visualize and monitor.
This dashboard is designed for semi-tech users.
This dashboard only does classification, the models are trained beforehand with Notebooks and simple scripts.
This dashboard puts all the aforementioned theory into practice with streaming, making it one of the most important chapters.

\section{Project Structure}

\label{subsec:frontend}

Maybe a small charting/data visualization library comparison here?
This chapter is also around the 5 page mark in length.

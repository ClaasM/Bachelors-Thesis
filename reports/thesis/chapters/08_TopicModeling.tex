\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

\subsection{LDA}
\label{subsec:lda}

\begin{itemize}
    \item

    \item
    Show results on training & test data of both datasets, maybe even with and without preprocessing (to prove yet again that the preprocessing made sense)

\end{itemize}

Difficult to assess num_stop_words

Use stopword list https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19130512/stopword-removal-with-nltk (Porter et al)

Wordcloud of training data set post stopwords removal (and comparison to pre stopword and pre preprocessing wordclouds in \ref{sec:streamingSampleDataset} and \ref{sec:theSandersDataset})

Genism offers required functionality (See sources from https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/wiki.html#latent-dirichlet-allocation)

Also doing it on the Sanders dataset for the sake of completeness

\subsection{LSA}
\label{subsec:lsa}

\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

Can't call it "Comparison" in parallel to sentiment analysis since topic models are not really objectively comparable.
Can't call it "Results" since there is already a chapter that is named that.
